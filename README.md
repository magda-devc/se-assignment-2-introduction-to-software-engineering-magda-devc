Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. It also involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering involves developing systems that power various aspects of modern life, it applies scientific and mathematical principles to the design, analysis and implementation of software systems while traditinal programming is just writing code to solve specific problems.




Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1. Requirements- This involves collecting informatin about the users needs and specifications.
2. Design- Developing detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface and building frameworks.
3. Implementation- engineers and developers code and change the software design into actual code according to the specifications.
4. Testing- involves conducting tests to ensure that the software meets the users needs and the standards.
5. Deployment- Presenting the software to the end-users.
6. Maintenance- Constant assistance and improvements to the software to meet customer expectations 




Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall involves completing each project phase before moving on to the next, it emphasizes on planning upfront the different phases of development. Agile involves breaking a project into smaller, more manageable chunks and continuously iterating and improving. Instead of following a predetermined plan, Agile emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between team members throughout the entire project cycle to accommodate change.
- Waterfall is best suited for projects with a clear set of requirements that donâ€™t change much over time and where risk and uncertainty are low.
- Agile is better for exploratory projects where conditions may evolve or change over time.




Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

It is the process of defining, creating, documenting, and maintaining requirements.
- Process:A feasibility study is first conducted then requirements extraction, specifications, verification and management.
- Importance- It provides an unambiguous description of the requirements, which helps to reduce misunderstandings and errors. Helps to identify potential conflicts and contradictions in the requirements.




Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components.
- It improves maintainability in such a way that when ome module has been changed or updated the impact is limited to that one specific module only reducing risks.
- It also improves scalability  by allowing for easier integration of new features. New modules can be added without affecting existing ones, making it easier to extend the functionality of the system.




Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1. Unit testing- This is testing individual modules of software.
2. Integration testing- This is testing interactions between different components.
3. System testing- Testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs.
It is crucial as it identifies potential issues before they reach end-users, reducing the likelihood of software failures.




Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. It enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, it also  maintains a history of changes, providing a trace for accountability and troubleshooting.
Eg; Git, Subversion, Mercurial




Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

- He/she oversees the planing, execution and delivery of software projects. They also assign resources to tasks, reduce project failure risks, select the right team members, understand their working personalities, and match them to project requirements.
- Challenges: Poor planning, lack of communication between the team members, insufficient resources and budget.




Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

- It involves modifying and updating software after it has been deployed. 
- There are several types of maintenance, including corrective (this is fixing errors detected), adaptive (adapting to the environment in which it has been used), perfective (enhancing attributes of the software) and preventive (preventing problems and viruses from affecting the system). 
Maintenance also provides user support and training.
- The goal of maintenance is to correct faults, improve performance and adapt the software to a changing environment throughout its lifetime hence an essential part in the software lifecycle.




Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Protection of customer data- individual may input their passwords in the software and if it is not secure enough, their data mighht be leaked.
- Algorithmic bias- Computers cannot understand morality as a concept, when it is not thoroughly checked, its systems can unintentionally show bias.
- Overemhasis on features.
- Addictive design.
- Software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by eduation and training. They can also actively engage in conversations about ethical considerations, prioritizing accountability and advocating for diversity and inclusion.
